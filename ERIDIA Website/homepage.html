    <div class= "central-column">  <p>We are devoted to providing the best possible 
        tutoring service to our clients and as part of that we create customisable lesson 
        plans based upon you or your child's own specific learning style. To determine what 
        your learning style is we use a process called the VARK system, whereby the tutee 
        fills in a simple personality quiz style questionnaire. There are no right or wrong 
        answers, it simply determines whether they are a Visual Learner, an Auditory Learner, 
        a Reading and Writing Learner or if they are a Kinaesthetic Learner.</p> 

        <p>Some people will only be one type of learner and some people will have a combined 
            learning type. We can also use the results from this quiz to customise revision 
            resources that will best suit them. For example, a Visual Learner might benefit 
            from visual aids like posters or mind maps, whereas an Auditory Learner may like
             to voice record their notes and play them back at a later date to refresh their 
             memory. With kinaesthetic learners it is a little bit more challenging because they
              learn by doing things and by physically being involved in the learning process. 
              For these type of learners we might produce flashcard resources or use game-based
               revision exercises in our lessons together. </p>
