    Eridia Tutoring is run by two friends from the University of Nottingham. 
    Our names are India and Eridona and we met as first years in halls together in 2017.
     We were like chalk and cheese at first and drove each other up the wall, but we think 
     all the best friendships start off that way. The name of our small business, 
     'Eridia Tutoring', is based on a combination of our first names and we hope you 
     love it as much as we do! We partner together to teach English and Maths to students 
     of all ages.</p>
    
    <p> Eridona handles the numbers; she has a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Economics and
        a Master's in Finance and Investment and is currently working in the corporate world as 
        a Commercial Analyst. She previously worked for Kumon and MagicMaths, tutoring primary school 
        children privately and in local schools in the Nottinghamshire Area. </p>

        <p>India is returning to education after a stint in the fashion industry as a Menswear Designer
            and is getting a Bachelors Degree in English Literature. She hopes to become a Fashion Writer 
            once she graduates. She previously worked as an online tutor for MyTutor, helping GCSE and A level 
            students achieve their academic goals throughout the pandemic.
